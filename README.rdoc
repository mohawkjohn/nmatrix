== Description

NMatrix is an experimental linear algebra library for Ruby, written mostly in C. It can be used with or without SciRuby, but is part of the SciRuby project.

NMatrix was inspired by and based heavily upon {NArray}[http://narray.rubyforge.org], by Masahiro Tanaka.

=== WARNING:

Please be aware that SciRuby and NMatrix are in *PRE-ALPHA* status. If you're thinking of using SciRuby/NMatrix to write mission critical code, such as for driving a car or flying a space shuttle, you may wish to choose other software (for now).

== Features

* Matrix storage containers: dense, yale, list (more to come)
* Data types: int8, int16, int32, int64, float32, float64, complex64, complex128, rational64, rational128 (incomplete)
* Very basic algebra (more to come)

== SYNOPSIS:

From the command line,

    git clone https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix.git
    cd nmatrix
    bundle
    rake compile
    rake console

Gem coming later.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ATLAS and LAPACK, probably
* GCC 4.2
* Ruby 1.9

== INSTALLATION:

See Synopsis (above) for now. Gem coming later.
